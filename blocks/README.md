## Plan on improving the project

A picutre is worth a thousand words. I have no idea what a Cortado is, prime example of a missed opertunity for a sale. let's get some photos in place to show off the product, espicalty a coffee shop leaning so hard into personalized offerings. Blue? Velvet Cake? Bug'uette? Web Cookies? Sunrise in the bay area? We need photos.

We should probably also move to more earthy tones, and color on backgrounds and graphics. I think it would help push the messaging around conservation, and tie in well with the dark and light browns associated with coffee.

Coffee has a flexable earth tone color spectrum the webpage should feel warmer. Less cool blue.
